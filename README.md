# IT Issue Logger (Python)

A practical Python-based application designed to log, validate, and manage common IT issues.
The project simulates a simple IT support/helpdesk workflow and demonstrates structured
troubleshooting, data handling, and security-aware input validation.

## Overview

This tool allows users to record IT-related issues such as software, hardware, and network
problems. Each issue is stored with a timestamp and description, making it easy to review,
search, and analyse recurring problems.

The project is intended as a hands-on example of how entry-level IT and software development
skills can be applied to real-world scenarios.
